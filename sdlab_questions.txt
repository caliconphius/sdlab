## QUESTION 1:
# Your goal was to produce a plot of NET MASS CHANGE over time. Describe why this could not
# be done without some sort of INTERPOLATION?

## ANSWER 1:
# In our data, to produce the plot of net mass change we needed to integrate over the total change in mass in the field over time. 
# This required us to combine the data from 3 injection wells, in the equation dm/dt = iw1 - pw1 -pw2. However, these all had a different 
# number of points (pw1 was measured every month while pw2 was measured every quarter and iw1 was measured once a year), meaning that we had
# to figure out a good approximation of the values at the points where the data has not been collected , i.e. the data must be interpolated
# in order to get the total mass flow rate.

## QUESTION 2:
# Your goal was to produce a plot of NET MASS CHANGE over time. Describe why this could not
# be done without some sort of numerical INTEGRATION?

## ANSWER 2:
# We have been given data concerning the mass flow rate into the field but not any information about the total change in net mass of the 
# field. To get from a flow rate to a net change, the flow rate must be integrated. However, since we only have sampled data about the flow
# rates and not an analytical function, we have to numerically integrate to get an approximation of the total mass change in the field.

## QUESTION 3:
# Could the operator of the field be considered responsible for the earthquakes?

## ANSWER 3:
# In our data, we notice that the three measured earthquakes appear to be correlated with injection into the well, their magnitude increasing
# only as the amount of water injected into the well approached 10^9 kg. Thus the claim by the operator that they cannot be responsible for 
# these earthquakes needs to be more thoroughly examined. Ideally, more data should be collected from wells and through stronger conclusions 
# can be reached regarding the correlation between injection and earthquakes.
